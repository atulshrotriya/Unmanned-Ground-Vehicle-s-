# Unmanned-Ground-Vehicle-s-
This project implements a front steered unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with front wheel streering to reach the goal using potential fields method. It then tries to guide two different UGV's with point mass dynamics to reach the same goal.

This project has further been updated and the latest results allow collaborative motion in different formations to find the optimal path in the presence of faulty nodes.
